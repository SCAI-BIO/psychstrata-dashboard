## Literature Evidence on Predictors of Treatment Resistance

* **Baseline severity (PHQ-9 / symptom severity) → higher TR risk**
  Greater baseline severity predicts poorer response and higher risk of later treatment resistance or nonremission
  [Papakostas 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26016766/) · [Souery et al. 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16727297/)

* **Longer episode duration / chronicity → more likely TR**
  Longer current episode or chronic depression is associated with poorer outcomes and more refractory illness
  [Souery et al. 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16727297/) · [Fekadu et al. 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19193338/)

* **Prior treatment failures → higher TR risk**
  The number of prior failed adequate antidepressant trials consistently predicts lower chance of response with subsequent monotherapy
  [Berlim & Turecki 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17388795/) · [Fava 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12716236/)

* **Poor adherence increases TR risk**
  Nonadherence and early discontinuation contribute to apparent treatment resistance
  [Souery et al. 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16727297/)

* **Dose-response for SSRIs (sertraline)**
  Sertraline shows substantial efficacy in typical dose ranges (50–200 mg). 50 mg is often effective, while higher doses (100–200 mg) may provide limited additional benefit
  [Hieronymus et al. 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27052632/) · [Cipriani et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29477251/)

* **Quetiapine augmentation**
  Quetiapine (especially XR, 150–300 mg/day) has evidence as augmentation or monotherapy in MDD/TRD, with modest effect but tolerability concerns
  [Komossa et al. 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20091549/) · [Nelson & Papakostas 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19289445/)

* **Lithium augmentation**
  Lithium augmentation has a strong evidence base for TRD, with significant augmentation effects at therapeutic doses (600–900 mg/day or targeted plasma levels)
  [Nelson et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25016772/) · [Bschor 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24792557/)

* **Early improvement by week 2 → lower TR risk**
  Early symptom decrease in the first 1–2 weeks predicts later response and remission; lack of early improvement is a strong predictor of nonresponse
  [Stassen et al. 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17388796/) · [Szegedi et al. 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19607757/)

* **Sleep disturbance / insomnia → higher TR risk**
  Insomnia and sleep disturbance predict worse antidepressant outcomes and are common in TRD
  [Wichniak et al. 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28427964/) · [Dew et al. 1997](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9255847/)

* **Substance use → higher TR risk**
  Substance use disorders, especially regular use, worsen antidepressant outcomes and complicate treatment
  [Nunes & Levin 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15033227/) · [Fava 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12716236/)

* **Comorbid anxiety → higher TR risk**
  Anxiety comorbidity is associated with more severe depression and worse treatment outcomes
  [Papakostas 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26016766/)

* **Side effects → higher TR risk**
  Side effects often lead to dose reductions or discontinuation, causing inadequate trials and treatment failure
  [Souery et al. 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16727297/)

* **Sex differences (female vs male)**
  Evidence on sex differences in antidepressant response is mixed; most large studies show negligible or inconsistent effects
  [Khan et al. 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15794786/) · [Papakostas 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26016766/)
